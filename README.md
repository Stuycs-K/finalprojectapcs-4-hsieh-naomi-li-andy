# Project Description

lorem ipsum.

# Intended usage:

To play the game, users must first select a piece to move by clicking on said piece. Several squares will then be lit up, as shown with a brighter pokeball that has a red center, indicating squares the selected piece can move to. Users must then click on one of the selected squares to successfully move their piece. Clicking on any square not lit up will force the users to repeat the process until a legal move is made. Users can change the piece they want to move simply by clicking on another piece.

Users must also be able to use their keyboard to access the guide and pawn promotion. See the table below for further details.
