### 2025-05-19 - Updated Proposal

Both of us worked on updating the proposal to be more specific regarding the Pokemon chess idea, and we sent the email regarding the revision to the proposal. We spent 25 minutes on this, and we will spend the rest of the class period beginning to build the prototype.

At home: I updated the prototype description with more details on the exact things we will be implementing in our critical features and nice-to-have features in list format (note: had to take a few commits debugging). I also added a timeline of what our workflow will likely look like. (Total time elapsed ~40-50 minutes).
### 2025-05-20 - Updated Prototype
In class: Andy and I worked out the timeline/breakdown of who's doing what of the project (~10 minutes) and for the rest of class I worked on the outline of the methods

At home: I finished up the outline of the methods, writing down the classes, methods, and instance variables with descriptions for the methods (~40 minutes)

### 2025-05-22 - Started Coding Movement
In class: Andy and I worked on laying out the methods for each class in their respective files and branching as well as thinking out how to approach the methods (~40 minutes).  

At home: I coded the movement methods for the king piece, the knight piece, and the rook piece, as well as updating some of the keywords and inheriting the accessor methods (~60 minutes).

### 2025-05-23 to 2025-05-26 - Designs, Constructors, and Captures
In class: I wrote constructors for King, Knight, and Rook and wrote the capture method in Piece (~40 minutes).

At home: I wrote getLegalMoves() as suggested by Mr. K (~20 minutes), designed the chessboard (~60 minutes) and created designs for some of our pieces (Ditto, Spheal, Piplup, Mew) (~100 minutes).

### 2025-05-27 - More Designs, Mouseclicked, and Move Fixes 
In class: I fixed the Rook's reachable function so it would check if the position it was trying to reach is blocked by another piece and started a new Gulpin design (~40 minutes). 

At home: I finished up the Gulpin design (~15 minutes) and wrote mouseClicked() (~30 minutes). 

### 2025-05-28 - Display and Pawn Movement
In class: I began writing the draw function, which would update the chessboard for its positions (~15 minutes).

At home: I finished up the draw method and debugged the pawn movement, also implementing the legal two squares first move (~40 minutes).

### 2025-05-29 - Debugging Movement & Check
In class: I debugged the movement for all pieces, as they weren't changing their position before. I also updated all the accessor/mutator methods to inherit correctly (~35 minutes).

At home: I finished debugging, updating the methods, and implemented a prototype version of check (~30 minutes).

### 2025-05-30 to 2025-06-01 - Debugging, King Movement, En Passant, Pawn Promotion, Castling, and Designs
In class: I worked on check and tried to debug king movement (~35 minutes).

At home: I finished debugging king movement (~40 minutes), created two new designs (~75 minutes), set up the designs (~20 minutes), implemented en passant (~75 minutes), implemented pawn promotion (~40 minutes), and implemented castling (~120 minutes) (these times include debugging). 

### 2025-06-02 - Legal Movement Marker
In class: I began a basic implementation of the legal movement marker, writing a dittoLight function to test captures as well (~35 minutes).

At home: I finished the legal movement marker, wrote alternate designs for all the pieces for when they can be captured, implemented the legal movement marker for captures, and made it so the king would light up when in check (~60 minutes).

### 2025-06-03 - Legal Movement Marker (More!)
In class: I implemented the legal movement marker for castling and started the en passant one (~40 minutes).

At home: I finished the legal movement marker for en passant and wrote the legal movement marker to fix the illegal moves (that allow your king to be captured) (~60 minutes).

### 2025-06-04 to 2025-06-05 - Win Screen/Guide setup
In class: I implemented the code to generate a win screen and began to write a crown function for the winscreen (~30 minutes).

At home: I finished the crown function and began a setup for the guide, which I will use PImage for (~30 minutes).

### 2025-06-06 to 2025-06-08 - Win Screen/Guide
In class: I began the design for the guide (~40 minutes).

At home: I finished designing the guide and end screens (~255 minutes---it took a while to handwrite/draw everything with my finger since I was doing it on phone), implemented the Pimage loading, resizing, etc. (~20 minutes), implemented a stalemate cheat button (~15 minutes) and fixed some last bugs (~10 minutes). Our recording took around 60 minutes.

### Teammate Confirmation
I, Andy Li, believe this document accurately reflects the contributions of my teammate.
