Both of us worked on updating the proposal to be more specific regarding the Pokemon chess idea, and we sent the email regarding the revision to the proposal.

### 2025-05-20 - UML for Prototype
In Class: Naomi and I worked out the timeline/breakdown of who's doing what of the project (~10 minutes) and I started working on the UML afterwards.

At home, I completed Part 2 of the necessary tasks to be completed for Stage 1 of this project and made sure everything was set. Completed the UML diagram that showcases our Chess class hierarchy as well as instance variables/methods (~15 minutes).
